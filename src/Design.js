          What do you call a designer who also understands front-end development? Many titles have been thrown around in an attempt to answer this very question: interaction designer, design/UI engineer (getting warmer?), designer-who-codes, responsive designer, ….unicorn?
Personally, I’m a fan of an emerging term, “frontend designer.” It combines the key components of both job descriptions in what IMO, is the most clear, straightforward way.
The Germans do a thing — which is totally grammatically correct by the way — where they just keep squishing adjectives together to form longer and longer words when the speaker or writer doesn’t feel one exists already that adequately communicates their intended meaning. I, for one, am fine with jumping on that bandwagon if it means companies will stop posting job descriptions for “ninjas”, “gurus”, “rockstars” and the like.

          When we’re writing HTML and CSS, we’re defining content and making decisions around appearance, usability, and interaction. We’re designing. But instead of using Photoshop or Sketch, we use a text editor and a browser. Our tools are different — our role is not.
So what’s the difference between design and front-end development?
